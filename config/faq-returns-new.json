Apply cold-weld bonding glue along with the click-lock profiles of the surrounding floors and drop in the new tile or plank. Make sure the click-lock profiles are properly secured to each other. Using a rubber mallet, tap along the profiles and ensure the replaced tile or plank is installed properly. \r\nYou can find a video of how to replace your floors in the link below: <a href=\"https://newageproducts.com/support-hub/\"> https://newageproducts.com/support-hub/</a> "

				"question": "Is my granite countertop sealed?",
				"answer": "NewAge Granite Countertops do not come pre-sealed."
			},
			{
				"question": "Do I need to seal my countertop?",
				"answer": "A sealed countertop is not required for indoor use. For outdoor use, a sealed countertop is highly recommended. A sealed countertop will reduce the risk surface stains and damages. A protected stone will be easier to maintain as well."
			},
			{
				"question": "Are NewAge Granite Countertops easy to maintain?",
				"answer": "NewAge Granite Countertops are easy to maintain! Using a clean damp cloth, wipe any spills as soon as possible and avoid using abrasive scrubbing tools. Please follow our care and maintenance guideline carefully found in the link: <a href=\"https://newageproducts.com/support-hub/granite-countertops\">https://newageproducts.com/support-hub/granite-countertops </a> "
			},
			{
				"question": "Will heat damage my countertop?",
				"answer": "NewAge Granite Countertops are temperature resistant; this means that they are able to withstand the heat of pots and pans without damage.(It takes 80 to 90-degree difference within your granite countertops to cause enough thermal stress to cause it to crack. If you heat a piece of granite uniformly, it will take many hundreds of degrees before any problems arise. Please note granite tops will draw the heat from food dishes or a delivered pizza very quickly.)"
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I cut directly on my granite countertop?",
				"answer": "Granite is a hard stone; using a kitchen knife on this surface is unlikely to result in scratches. While knives will not scratch the stone, cutting directly on the countertop is not recommended. Acidic substances found in many foods can potentially penetrate the stone and cause discoloration. Additionally, you run the risk of damaging and dulling your knives."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will my countertops fade over time?",
				"answer": "Granite is a natural stone that will fade if it is left out in direct sunlight over the course of several years. Fading in an interior setting is less common, as UV rays from indoor lights are much less corrosive than sunlight."
			},
			{
				"question": "Are NewAge Granite Countertops under warranty?",

				"question": "Can my sink rust?",
				"answer": "NewAge Sinks are made from 304 grade stainless steel and are corrosion resistant. However, rust stains may form over time if the sink is not properly maintained, caused by deposits from water or foods. Scrubbing the stains with a mild cleanser or metal cleaner should solve this problem immediately. Be sure to clean in the same direction as the grain lines of the finish."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can hardwater spots be removed?",
				"answer": "If you notice hard water spots on the surface of your sink, take the following steps to bring your sink back to its original condition. 1. Apply clean water with a cleaning sponge and rub gently in the direction of the grain. If the mark won’t shift, it may be necessary to use a stainless steel cleaner, in which case apply the cleaner and rub gently. 2. After cleaning it is important to rinse the stainless steel with clean fresh water and buff with a soft cloth. Remember to always rub with the grain, NEVER across as you will ruin the finish, and the steel can lose its shine. If you must use a scourer, use a plastic scrub pad with no metal content."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I use a rubber mat in my sink?",
